# Final Lessons

In the last two days of the course I want(ed) you to research what is currently happening in artificial intelligence. On the first day of the course we talked about a lot of different areas:
* Natural Language Processing
* Computer Vision
* Robotics
* Logic
* Game Playing
* Decision Making
* Machine Learning

If we had class everyone would have looked for material online (tutorials, news articles, academic papers, videos) and shared the best things they could find by adding it here on GitHub. That didn't happen, but I still have some resources for you.

## Machine Learning Introduction Articles

* [A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) - I posted this on my Facebook because I think it's a very cool website. It introduces one machine learning technique: **decision trees**.
* [Machine Learning is Fun! (Part One)](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471) - this article introduces some core concepts in ML (supervised vs unsupervised learning) and then walks through an example of **multivariate linear regression** from first principles.

## Fun Artificial Intelligence

* [Playing Mario with AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlkMs4ZHHr8) - a few years ago there was a series of competitions where the goal was to write an AI to play Mario. As you can see from this video, the AIs got very good at it. I also [did a project in university](https://github.com/mjalkio/MarioAI) with these AIs, I'll show you in class!

## News Articles

* [Human-Like: Facebook is using our data to build the 'world's best' Artificial Intelligence lab](http://www.popsci.com/facebook-ai)
* [How Google is Remaking Itself as a "Machine Learning First" Company](https://backchannel.com/how-google-is-remaking-itself-as-a-machine-learning-first-company-ada63defcb70)
