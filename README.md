# UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI -- Course Materials (Spanish)

This repository will contain materials from http://ai.berkeley.edu/ translated into Spanish (by Google Translate) for a series of Artificial Intelligence workshops in Lambayeque, Peru. The workshops were organized thanks to a collaboration between AIESEC in Chiclayo and Universidad Nacional Pedro Ruiz Gallo.

The instructor for the workshops is Michael Jalkio (@mjalkio), an exchange participant from AIESEC at Cornell University. His involvement in the project is sponsored through the PwC-AIESEC Global Citizen Fund.
